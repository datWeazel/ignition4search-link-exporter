# ignition4search-link-exporter
# &#x1F534; CustomsForge/Ignition4 introduced a breaking change shortly after I contacted the main developer. I'm currently trying to get the script working again.

This Greasemonkey userscript adds the option to show download links of multiple files on ignition4.  
  
Simply select all files you want to download and click the exclamationmark-button in the top left to display download links of all selected songs. That way you can copy and paste all links into a download manager like jDownloader.
