# ignition4search-link-exporter

This Greasemonkey userscript adds the option to show download links of multiple files on ignition4.  
  
Simply select all files you want to download and click the exclamationmark-button in the top left to display download links of all selected songs. That way you can copy and paste all links into a download manager like jDownloader.
